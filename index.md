As a result China has become a much larger consumer of commodities and raw materials with increased influence on commodity demand and pricing.

Latin American economies have long relied heavily on commodity exports, from Spanish colonial shipments of precious metals to

The China/Latin America GDP Correlation Shiny App is a data visualization tool that allows the user to get a visual sense of how closely certain key Latin American economies are tied to China's.
